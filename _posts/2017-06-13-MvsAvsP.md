In python everything is a object. Considering this

> MetaClass is a class whose instances are classes.

> We can not create any instance using abstract class.

> Parent class is a classs we just use this have import all attibutes and functionalities.

Did not get it why late, let us dive in

## MetaClass

Considering my above statement let us see class of each object. Try this in python3

``` python
class A():
    pass

A.__class__
<class 'type'>
```

So here class of a class is a **type**. Here type is a metaclass for all the classes in python. Now, we are going to create a meta class using this type as **parent class**.

``` python
class MetaA(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        x=super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
        x.default_value = 100
        return x
```

The above class is a metaclass whose instance will be a class. Using this metaclass let us create a class and see its argument

``` python
class A(metaclass=MetaA):
    pass

A.default_value
100
```
Try following for better understanding the above metaclasses

``` python
a=type()
a=MetaA() # This throws an error

MetaB = type('MetaB', (), {})
print(MetaB)
<class '__main__.A'>
```
So here we can not directly creata a class from the metaclasses we use above shown format and the resultant will be a class.
